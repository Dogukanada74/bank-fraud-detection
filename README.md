# Bank Fraud Detection Machine with Real-Life Data

## Description
This project is a machine learning model designed to detect fraudulent bank transactions using real-life data. The model is trained on an imbalanced dataset and uses techniques like Random Forest and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) for handling the class imbalance.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling.
- Model Building: Implements Random Forest Classifier and evaluates using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- SMOTE: Applied to handle class imbalance by oversampling the minority class.
- Evaluation: Includes confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy metrics.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dogukanada74/bank-fraud-detection.git

## Dataset

I couldn't upload the CSV file I used because it was too large. Instead, I shared the link to the dataset:
